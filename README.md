# How to Build a Time Machine

The goal is to design a piece of software that uses the guardian's API. 

Here is the [challenge] we were issued. (https://github.com/foundersandcoders/fac5/blob/master/week2/assignment.md).

The website should let you easily search for articles about a given topic from a given year.

There are lots of test/research files here that will be tidied up but for the time being the relevant files are:
+ index.html (main page)
+ main.css (styling)
+ ajax.js (bulk javascript)
+ ajaxtest.js (tests)

The website is live at [guardiantimemachine.com](http://jmnr.github.io/api/)

## To Do:

+ Error Handling


## Day 1 Workflow:

+ concept development
+ user stories
+ wire frames
+ basic tests
+ api registration
+ gitflow
+ webpage page html and css
+ webpage js

## Day 2 Workflow:

+ Adding tabs with content that work
+ Integrating the different test and Index files
+ Making sure everything works
+ Forst successful js test
+ Upload everything to gh-pages

## Day 3 Workflow:

+ Replaced tab function with a Carousel
+ Created more tests
+ Cleared up thefile structure
+ Added 'use strict' to all the functions
+ Added multiple serach term functionality
+ Add a 'most viewed' filter for best results to show up

## How to Test

+ Open the file named testFile.html. This is a duplicated of the test file with qunit added to it.
+ The page will automatically run the tests in a file named 'tests.js', to view individual tests open this file.
