# How to Build a Time Machine

## Day 1

Today we worked on a concept to design a piece of software that uses the guardian's API. The goal is to design a website that lets you easily search for articles about a given topic from a given year.

##Workflow:

+ concept development
+ user stories
+ wire frames
+ basic tests
+ api registration
+ gitflow
+ webpage page html and css
+ webpage js

Tomorrow we will work on adding content and maybe even some tests to the mix.
