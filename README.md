# How to Build a Time Machine

The goal is to design a piece of software that uses the guardian's API. 

Here is the [challenge](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/fac5/blob/master/week2/assignment.md).

The website should let you easily search for articles about a given topic from a given year.

There are lots of test/research files here that will be tidied up but for the time being the relevant files are:
+ index.html (main page)
+ main.css (styling)
+ ajax.js (bulk javascript)
+ ajaxtest.js (tests)

The website is live at [guardiantimemachine.com](http://jmnr.github.io/api/)

+ Error Handling
+ Replacing tab function with a Carousel
